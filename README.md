# Java Spring-PostgreSQL Portfolio

A web application that serves as my personal portfolio. Uses a Java Spring backend to serve web pages that are generated by the Thymeleaf templating engine. Thymeleaf utilizes Java classes that are stored within a PostgreSQL database maintained by Hibernate, Java Spring PostgreSQL, and JPA. The Java Spring portfolio also utilizes the Java Spring Email API in order send personal emails to allow visitors to seamlessly contact me. Core concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are also utilized.
